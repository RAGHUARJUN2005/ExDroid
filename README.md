# Photoshop ExDroid

ExDroid exports all your Photoshop layers as single PNG24 files in all Android relevant resolutions from <b>mdpi</b> to ldpi, hdpi, xhdpi, xxhdpi. This script is based on the [Photoshop-Export-Layers-as-Images](https://github.com/jwa107/Photoshop-Export-Layers-as-Images) by [Johannes Walter](https://github.com/jwa107). ExDroid by [Philipp Paul](https://github.com/bobbor) and [Peter Amende](https://github.com/zutrinken).


## Descriptions

Saves each layer in the active document to a PNG file named after its layers in automatically created subdirectories like `/drawable-*resolution*/`. Handles nesting in grouped layers.

IMPORTANT: Your document has to be planned as <b>mdpi</b>.

HINT: Work with paths!

_Disclaimer:_ Please use script at your own risk. I have not tested it thoroughly enough to guarantee that it is in fact bulletproof.

## Requirement

Adobe Photoshop CS2 or higher.

## How To Use

1. Open Photoshop
